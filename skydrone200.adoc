== About the Project ==
Based on our existing 'Drone-in-a-Box' solution, a prototype for a smaller system shall be developed.

Design Goals:

- Small UAV with a maximum takeoff weight of 250g.
- Weatherproof (IP43)
- Optimized for best-in-class range/endurance
- Mechanically simple base station that can be deployed either fixed or moving on a vehicle
- Potentially have a Network of Charging stations to go from station to station and have a 'swarm' of small drones.

Target Use:

- Quick aerial intelligence from a system deployed on a rescue vehicle that can be operated from remote command center
- Surveying & Mapping

== UAV ==

Core Components:

- flight controller
- motor controller (4-in-1)
- Sky Drone Core Compute Board
- Sky Drone Charging Controller
- downward facing camera
- front facing camera
- RTK-GPS module
- RTK-GPS antenna
- 4 motors
- 4 props
- Battery
- 4G/5G Antennas
- Gimbal / Gimbal Controller? (see below)

=== Feasability of a Gimbal solution ===

The drone will have two camera, one downward facing camera and one front facing camera.
If the weight budget allows, it would be ideal to have a 2-axis gimbal supporting the front camera.

- "Without the gimbal, with a GF5030 props, the quad weights only 110g. With a 2s 3000mah li-on , flight time is between 50 and 60min."

== Base Station ==

Considerations:

- 12V power supply (usable on a vehicle)
- RTK GPS (use on vehicle)
- 4G/5G connected
- miniminze number of actuators required
- ability to firmly hold the drone (e.g. vehicle use)
- low power (can be solar powered with small panel/buffer battery)
